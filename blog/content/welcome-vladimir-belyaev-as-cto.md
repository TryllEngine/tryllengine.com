**Vladimir is an ex-Playrix Executive Technical Director with 30 years of experience across the gaming industry, including 11 years in senior leadership roles.**

He brings deep game engine expertise, strong GPU and performance intuition, practical ML experience in games, and years spent at one of the strongest game companies in the world.

## His background includes:

- **Game engines and core systems**, from building foundations to scaling platforms
- **Graphics, rendering, and GPU-level optimization** — essential for on-device inference
- **Machine learning applied in game development**, including AI-assisted tooling, testing, and production workflows
- **Technical leadership across both 0→1 and 1→scale products**

Vladimir was introduced to us by our shareholder & partner, Andrei Morozov, with whom they've met 21 years ago. It's great to see them work together again :)

We're very happy to have Vladimir with us as we build the next generation of AI-native game technology.

Welcome to the team!
